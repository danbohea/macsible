# Macsible

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danbohea/macsible.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danbohea/macsible)

### Requirements

Ensure the following requirements are already installed and working on your local system:

- macOS 10.10, 10.11 or 10.12 ([help](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372)).
- Command Line Developer Tools ([help](docs/install_command_line_developer_tools.md)).
- Ansible ([help](docs/install_ansible.md)).

## Forking and customisation overview

1. Fork the repository at [https://github.com/macsible/macsible](https://github.com/macsible/macsible).
2. Clone the fork to your local system (this is now the repository you will use to store your own customisations).
3. Navigate to the local clone using your terminal app of choice.
4. Follow the usage instructions below.
5. Commit and push any customisations to your local clone back upstream to your fork.

You can see a working example of a forked and customised repository at [https://github.com/danbohea/macsible](https://github.com/danbohea/macsible).

## Usage

### Create required additional files

You'll need to create some additional files in the root of your project. A script has been included to automate this. To use it run:

```
bash create_fork_files.sh
```

This will create the following files based on the examples found in the src directory:

- config.yml
- config.local.yml
- mac-custom.yml
- requirements.yml

### Download externally sourced roles

Remotely sourced Ansible roles can be added to requirements.yml. Before running the playbook you'll need to download any Ansible roles specified in requirements.yml by running the following command:

```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --force
```

### Configure

Default variables can be overridden in config.yml.

config.local.yml can be used to override config.yml which can be useful when you need to use different values for just a few variables on a specific system. By default config.local.yml is ignored by git.

### Run the Ansible playbook

The primary Ansible playbook file is called macsible.yml and can be run using the command below (asks for sudo password). Note that running macsible.yml will in turn run your customised mac-custom.yml playbook.

```
ansible-playbook macsible.yml -K
```

To run only certain tags (e.g. `firefox` and `dev_apps`):

```
ansible-playbook macsible.yml -K -t "firefox,dev_apps"
```
